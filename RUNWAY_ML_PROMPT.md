# MatchColab - Runway ML Video Prompt (90sec, 3000 credits)

## 🎬 OVERVIEW
**MatchColab: AI-Powered Artist Collaboration Finder** | 90s tech demo | Dark UI (#0f172a→#1e293b), purple-pink accents (#6366f1→#ec4899), neon green (#10b981) | Cinematic, professional, music-focused

## 📝 SCENES

**S1: Hook (0-10s)** Producer hands on keyboard in dimly lit studio, purple/blue ambient glow. Dolly pullback reveals screen with "🎵 MatchColab" logo + tagline glowing. Particles emanate suggesting AI. Shallow depth of field, CRT scan lines. TEXT: "Stop guessing. Start collaborating."

**S2: Problem (10-18s)** Montage: frustrated artists scrolling social media/email, confused faces. Floating messages: "Who should I work with?" Visual chaos, multiple tabs. Fast cuts (2s each), zoom on faces. TEXT: "Finding the right collaborator is hard..."

**S3: Solution (18-28s)** Transition to MatchColab interface, dark gradient UI fades in. "Find Your Match" form highlighted with soft glow. Slow zoom, sequential element reveal (logo→tagline→form). Pulsing button. TEXT: "MatchColab uses AI to find your perfect collaborators"

**S4: Input (28-40s)** Cursor types "pop, r&b, contemporary r&b, trap soul" into tags field. Checkboxes: "Only successful history" checked. Artist name: "Luna Rivers". "Save profile" checked. Zoom on input area, fields highlight purple as cursor moves. TEXT: "Step 1: Describe your style with tags"

**S5: AI Magic (40-48s)** Click "🔍 Find Matches" button (satisfying press). Loading spinner. Abstract viz: musical notes→data points, neural network connections, glowing particle embeddings. Text: "AI analyzing 1000s..." Slow-mo particles floating upward, network pulses, gentle rotation. TEXT: "AI embedding technology analyzes semantic similarity + historical collaboration data"

**S6: Results (48-65s)** Cards cascade in from right with bounce. Each shows: artist name (e.g., "1. Ariana Grande"), 4 tag badges (pop, r&b, dance-pop, +2 more), score bar filling 0→87%, green badge "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED". Top 3 focus, parallax scroll. Score bars animate purple→green gradient. Hover lift+glow on one card. TEXT: "Get ranked matches with compatibility scores in seconds"

**S7: Features (65-78s)** Split screen, 3 panels zoom simultaneously with 3D depth: Left (🎯 AI-Powered Matching, OpenAI badge, embeddings viz) | Center (📊 Historical Success Data, bar chart) | Right (💾 Save Profile, card storing to cloud). Icons pulse. TEXT: "Powered by OpenAI embeddings + Supabase vector database"

**S8: Trust (78-85s)** Footer closeup: green status dot pulses, text "ok". Minimalist monitoring. "Built with ❤️ using OpenAI & Supabase". TEXT: "Real-time health monitoring · Production-ready · Scalable"

**S9: CTA (85-90s)** Dolly pullback from screen to full studio. Producer leans back satisfied, second artist enters frame, points excitedly at matches on screen. Both high-five. Warm lighting increases. Freeze on high-five. TEXT: "MatchColab.com | Start collaborating smarter" + animated logo glow

## 🎨 STYLE GUIDE
**Colors:** Cinematic dark mode, navy/slate shadows (#0f172a), purple-pink highlights (#6366f1→#ec4899), green success (#10b981), amber energy (#f59e0b)
**Typography:** Modern sans-serif (SF Pro/Segoe UI), gradient text on heroes
**Motion:** Smooth ease-in-out, subtle bounce, parallax depth, gentle float, 300-500ms transitions
**UI:** Rounded corners (0.5-1rem), soft shadows/glows, card layouts, gradient progress bars, pill tag badges
**Camera:** Slow deliberate movements, shallow depth close-ups, smooth easing, no jerky motion, professional stabilization
**Lighting:** Screen glow key light, purple/blue rim light, LED practicals, volumetric rays, no harsh shadows

## 📐 SPECS
16:9 (1920×1080) | 30fps | MP4 H.264 | Cinematic vocabulary: dolly, parallax, depth of field | Lighting: ambient, volumetric, neon

## 🎯 MESSAGE BEATS
Problem (10s) → Solution (18s) → Input Demo (28s) → AI Processing (40s) → Results (48s) → Features (65s) → Trust (78s) → CTA (85s)

## 🚀 RUNWAY TIPS
**Prompts:** Use cinematic terms (dolly, parallax, DOF), specify lighting (ambient/volumetric/neon), precise motion (smooth/float/cascade), tech aesthetic (dark UI, gradient, modern)
**Transitions:** Crossfade scene changes, match cut similar shapes, zoom for focus, light/glow wipes
**Budget (3000):** High quality key scenes, simple transitions, extend static frames, loop backgrounds. Priority: S3-6 (core demo)

## ✅ PRE-PROD
- [ ] Screen recordings (UI reference/overlay) | [ ] Studio photos | [ ] Text overlay timing | [ ] 90s music track | [ ] Style frames | [ ] 30s test first

## 💡 ALTERNATIVES
**Limited credits:** Focus S3-6, static title cards, extend key animations | **Max impact:** Screen reflections in glasses, artist testimonial, data viz, before/after split
